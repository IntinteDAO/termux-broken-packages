Free Pascal Compiler not exists in Termux

```
CMake Error at hedgewars/CMakeLists.txt:1 (enable_language):
  No CMAKE_Pascal_COMPILER could be found.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "FPC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_Pascal_COMPILER to the full
  path to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
